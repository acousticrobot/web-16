A Moment of Levity  
  
We sailed for hours  
to each one's own  
A real firecracker, that one  
and others more somber  
  
Did I mention the skies, so inviting that day  
with an effortless lift  
We could concentrate on things as important as  
simply breathing  
  
A memory is in nature a dream  
of something we believe happened  
A moment cannot be charged with  
holding an entire afternoon
