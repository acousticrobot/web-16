All of us are so excited that little Falcon is fine, because so much of -- so many of us all over the country today were deeply worried that he was stuck in that balloon. That balloon was out of control, simply flying around the skies of Colorado for a couple of hours.
Fortunately, he was hiding out in the garage attic the whole time in a box.
Richard, walk us through slowly but surely, what exactly happened to Falcon today and how all of this got so way, way out of control.
