M. HEENE: We just got surprised that the balloon -- the craft, it kept going up. And it's supposed to stay 20 feet above the ground. And that surprised us first. And, Richard and I kind of argued with, you know, I am supposed to tie it and it was not done correctly. And we -- we are so involved we forget about where the craft went.
And, meanwhile, Bradford had said Falcon is inside of it, Falcon inside of it. And we couldn't hear at first. And then I realized, what?
And that's the moment we realized what's happening.
