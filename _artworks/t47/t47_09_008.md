R. HEENE: Yes. Let me interrupt this real quick. I think I can see the direction you guys are hedging on this. Because earlier you had asked the police officers the question. The media out front, we weren't even going to do this view. And I'm kind of appalled, after all of the feelings that I went through, up and down, that you guys are trying to suggest something else. 
OK? I'm really appalled, because they said out in front that this would be the end, and I wouldn't have to be bothered for the rest of the week with any shows or anything. So we said OK, fine, we'll do this. So I'm kind of appalled that you guy would say something like that. You know?
