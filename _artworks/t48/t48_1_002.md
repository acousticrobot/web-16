excerpt: "as he was dragging the corpse great-hearted Agenor caught sight of him, and where his side was left uncovered by his shield as he stooped, there he struck him with a thrust of his bronze-tipped spear, and loosed his limbs. So his spirit left him, and over his body was made grievous toil of Trojans and Achaeans. Like wolves they lept on one another, and man made man to reel."

> As he fell lord Elephenor caught him by the feet, the son of Chalcodon and leader of the great-hearted Abantes, and tried to drag him from beneath the missiles, eager with all speed to strip off his armor; yet only a short while did his striving last; for as he was dragging the corpse great-hearted Agenor caught sight of him, and where his side was left uncovered by his shield as he stooped, there he struck him with a thrust of his bronze-tipped spear, and loosed his limbs. So his spirit left him, and over his body was made grievous toil of Trojans and Achaeans. Like wolves they lept on one another, and man made man to reel.

_Iliad_, 4.463-472 translated by A. T. Murray
