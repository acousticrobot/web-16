excerpt: "He had scarcely sallied out when Aias struck him in the breast by the right nipple. The bronze spear went clean through his shoulder and he came down in the dust, felled like a slender poplar with a bushy top that has shot up in the big meadows by a stream and is cut down by a wainwright with his gleaming axe."

> It was now the Telemonian Aias struck down Anthemion’s son, Simoisius. This sturdy youngster took his name from the River Simoïs, beside which he was born when his mother was returning from Mount Ida, where her father and mother had taken her to see their sheep. His life was too short for him to repay his parents for their loving care, for it ended when he met great Aias’ spear. He had scarcely sallied out when Aias struck him in the breast by the right nipple. The bronze spear went clean through his shoulder and he came down in the dust, felled like a slender poplar with a bushy top that has shot up in the big meadows by a stream and is cut down by a wainwright with his gleaming axe. Later, the man will make felloes from it for the wheels of a beautiful chariot; but he leaves it now to lie and season on the bank.Thus King Aias felled Simoisius, Anthemion’s son.

_Iliad_, 4.475-487 translated by E. V. Rieu
