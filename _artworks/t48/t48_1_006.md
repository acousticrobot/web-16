excerpt: "Now Amarinceus’ son
Diores—fate shackled Diores fast and a jagged rock
struck him against his right shin, beside the ankle."

> Now Amarinceus’ son
Diores—fate shackled Diores fast and a jagged rock
struck him against his right shin, beside the ankle.
Prious son of Imbrasus winged it hard and true,
the Thracian chief who had sailed across from Aenus…
the ruthless rock striking the bones and tendons
crushed them to pulp—he landed flat on his back,
slamming the dust, both arms flung out to his comrades,
gasping out his life. Pirous who heaved the rock
came rushing in and speared him up the navel—
his bowels uncoiled, spilling loose on the ground
and the dark came swirling down across his eyes.

_Iliad_, 4.517-526 translated by Robert Fagles
