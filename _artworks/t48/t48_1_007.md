> As Peirous moved off, Thoas, an Aetolian, hit him,
his spear striking him above the nipple. The bronze spear point
bit into his lungs. Thoas moved in to close quarters,
pulled the heavy spear out from his chest, drew his sharp sword,
then drove it straight into the middle of his belly,
destroying Peirous' life.

_Iliad_, 4.527-531 translated by Ian Johnston
