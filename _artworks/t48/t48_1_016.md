> …such was the rage of young Diomedes as he closed with the Trojans.
Next he killed Astynöos and Hypeiron, shepherd of people,
striking one with the bronze-heeled spear above the nipple,
and cutting the other beside the shoulder through the collar-bone
with the great sword, so that neck and back were hewn free of the
shoulder.

_Iliad_, 5.144-146 translated by Richmond Lattimore
