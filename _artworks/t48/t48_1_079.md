> …Quick with another arrow,
the archer let fly from his bowstring straight for Hector,
his spirit straining to hit him—shot and missed again
as Apollo skewed his shaft—
but he leveled Archeptolemus, Hector’s daring driver
charging headlong, caught him square in the chest
beside the nipple and off his car he pitched
as his horses balked pawing the air.

_Iliad_, 8.273-315 translated by Robert Fagles
