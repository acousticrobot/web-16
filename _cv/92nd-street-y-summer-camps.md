Founded in 1874, the 92nd Street Y is a nonprofit community and cultural center which hosts 300,000 annual visitors and millions more through the internet.

The Summer Camps site uses custom scripting to generate a draggable virtual map of the campsite.  Buildings on the map bring up window panes with videos, slideshows and animated panoramas of the actual camp.

Mobile detection diverts the viewer to a version which offers the same content through a drop-down list.
