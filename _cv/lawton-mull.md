Lawton Mull is an artworks, furniture and fine art objects retailer out of New York City. Running on WordPress, this site presents products organized by category, as well as rooms organized around multiple objects.

The inspiration tab, and soon to be on the home page as well, features custom javascript that takes an unordered list of images and text and continuously replaces the first one on the left. The order of the list is rearranged by the script, so the slideshow can loop endlessly.
