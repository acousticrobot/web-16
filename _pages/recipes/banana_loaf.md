Makes 2 loaves, amounts for a single loaf on bottom or recipe.

Adapted from Rose Levy Beranbaum's Banana Feather Loaf. This is an enriched bread,
and the sourdough culture is spiked with additional yeast for the second rise. For a
pure sourdough culture the instant yeast can be omitted and rise time increased.

For vegan version, omit the powdered milk and substitute oil by weight for butter.

### Leaven

Mix the day before

  * 200g all purpose flour
  * 120g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
  * 256g water
  * 40g brown sugar

Allow to rise at room temperature for about 4 hours and refrigerate overnight.
Take two black bananas out of the freezer and let then defrost in the fridge.

### Dough

Take Leaven, bananas and butter out of the fridge 1 hour before mixing to take off the chill.

Mix together in mixer bowl by hand until combined:

  * Leaven
  * 828g all purpose flour
  * 74g butter, room temperature
  * 4T powdered milk
  * 4 bananas (~300-450g total)
  * 1/2 - 1 t yeast

Allow to hydrate for 20 minutes, then add

  * 2t salt

This volume is a workout for a standard blender -- optionally divide the dough in half and mix in two batches.

Mix on medium speed for about 7 minutes, until smooth.  The dough should be slightly sticky, sticking to the bottom but
not the sides of the mixer.  Adjust with 1 spoon of flour or water at a time until desired consistency is reached,
you can use the relative weight of your bananas to predict which way you may have to adjust.

Let rest for about 2 hours, shape and transfer to a standard (8 1/2 x 4 1/2) loaf pan.  Let rise again 1-2 hours.

### Bake

1 hour before baking preheat oven to 475F.

After 5 minutes lower temperature to 375, and bake for 10 minutes.  Lower temperature to 350 and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Final internal temperature should be 190. Aim for a light brown crust, tent with foil if the top starts to brown too early.
