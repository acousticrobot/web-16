Adapted from Rose Levy Beranbaum's Banana Feather Loaf. This is an enriched bread,
and the sourdough culture is spiked with additional yeast for the second rise. For a
pure sourdough culture the instant yeast can be omitted and rise time increased.

For vegan version, omit the powdered milk and substitute oil by weight for butter.

### Leaven

Mix the day before

  * 100g all purpose flour
  * 60g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
  * 146g water
  * 20g brown sugar

Allow to rise at room temperature for about 4 hours and refrigerate overnight.
Take two black bananas out of the freezer and let then defrost in the fridge.

### Dough

Take Leaven, bananas and butter out of the fridge 1 hour before mixing to take off the chill.

Mix together in the mixer until combined:

  * Leaven
  * 414g all purpose flour
  * 37g butter, room temperature
  * 2T powdered milk
  * 2 bananas (~150-225g total)
  * 1/4 t yeast

Allow to hydrate for 20 minutes, then add

  * 1t salt

Mix on medium speed for about 7 minutes, until smooth.  The dough should be slightly sticky, sticking to the bottom but
not the sides of the mixer.  Adjust with 1 spoon of flour or water at a time until desired consistency is reached,
you can use the relative weight of your bananas to predict which way you may have to adjust.

Let rest for about 2 hours, shape and transfer to a large (8 1/2 x 4 1/2) loaf pan.  Let rise again 1-2 hours.

### Bake

1 hour before baking preheat oven to 475F.

After 5 minutes lower temperature to 375, and bake for 15 minutes.  Lower temperature to 350 and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes. Final internal temperature should be 190. Aim for a light brown crust, tent with foil if the top starts to brown too early.
