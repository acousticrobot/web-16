Adapted from Peter Reinhart's Marbled Rye. This is an enriched bread,
and the sourdough culture is spiked with additional yeast for the second rise. For a
pure sourdough culture the instant yeast can be omitted and rise time increased.

Makes two loaves

### Mix Dough

Make two loaves, one at a time:

  * 300g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
  * 162g water
  * 233g bread flour
  * 170g rye flour
  * 28g shortening, butter, or oil
  * 21g molasses
  * 11g salt
  * .5t commercial yeast

Add to the second loaf:

  * 18g caramel color

Optional:

  * 1.5t caraway seeds

### Proof

Rise until doubled (3 1/2 hours), cut each dough into 4 and shape squares roughly 1/2 thick and the length of the loaf pans. Layer largest to smallest: light, dark, light, dark, and roll, tucking in the ends.

Rise a second time until close to the top of the pans (2 hours).

### Bake

1 hour before baking preheat oven to 475F.

After 5 minutes lower temperature to 375, and bake for 15 minutes.  Lower temperature to 350 and bake for an additional _____ minutes. Final internal temperature should be 190. Aim for a light brown crust, tent with foil if the top starts to brown too early.
