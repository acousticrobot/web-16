  * mix by hand until it's smooth and not sticky
  * Refrigerate until stiff (~1.5 hours)

### Shape the Buns

  * Divide into 16, wrap around 1T filling, let rise 30 min more
  * Flatten the topping into 16 disks
  * Brush tops of buns with water, place topping disk on top
  * Brush with egg yolk (optional, for better color)
  * Bake at 375 for 15-17 minutes, switch trays 1/2 way if baking on two levels
