Makes two smaller or one large loaf.

Basic sourdough aiming for a well kneaded stiffer dough. The dry starter from day one makes for a more sour bread. Substitute wheat or any other flours for up to 10% of the flour on the second day.

Adapted from Peter Reinhart's Basic Sourdough.

### Starter

  * 115g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
  * 128g bread flour
  * 30-35g water

Bring starter to room temp ~1 hour before mixing. Add just enough water to for a stiff dough. Allow to ferment 4 hours until double, then refrigerate overnight.

### Dough

  * Starter from above
  * 575g bread flour
  * ~340g water at 90-100F

Bring starter to room temp ~1 hour before mixing, and cut into pieces. Mix with additional flour and water. Rest 20 min. Add:

  * 2t (15g) salt

Mix 7 min or until it passes the window pane test.

### Proof

Rise until doubled (3-4 hours), divide in two if making smaller loaves and shape in bannetons.

Rise a second time 2-3 hours.

### Bake

1 hour before baking preheat oven to 500F.

Standard steam treatment and immediately lower oven to 450F for 30-45 minutes, depending on size and shape of loaves.
