### Flour Mix

5 oz (1c) flour
8 oz sourdough starter (100% hydration)
1/2c yogurt
(1-2T milk or water if stiff)

Preferably let sit out overnight

### Batter

wisk together, then add flour mix and combine

  * 2 eggs
  * 1.5t baking powder
  * 2T sugar
  * 1t salt
  * 3T butter melted
  * 3/4 cup buttermilk

I tried dividing in 3, was not enough to fill waffle iron.
Next time try 1/2 in the waffler, and see if that's too much, then adjust flour.
