### toki pona

The language toki pona has been around since 2001, and the official toki pona book was published in 2014. I have started a [resource page](/toki-pona/about/) for additional information and links to other things toki pona.

### sitelen sitelen, or sitelen suwi

Starting around 2006, I began learning toki pona, and shortly afterwards, started developing a system of pictographic non-linear writing based on the language. toki pona lends itself quite well to a hieroglyphic script because of its minimal vocabulary and its emphasis on simplicity.

I began to call to this drawing process _sitelen suwi_, or sweet drawing, because of its emphasis on appealing curves and shapes. In toki pona, _sitelen_ can mean both drawing and writing, and John Clifford (jan Kipo) proposed _sitelen sitelen_ as the way to say _hieroglyphic_ using toki pona, literally 'drawing writing'.  This more official name became the way this system is most commonly referred to, but this term could really refer to any pictographic alphabet in toki pona. Sonja's _sitelen pona_, for instance, is technically another example of _sitelen sitelen_.

Either way, both names stuck, and whether you say _sitelen sitelen_ or _sitelen suwi_, other speakers of toki pona will probably think you are referring to this:

I like both names personally and I suppose I would sum it up like this: _mi pilin e ni: ona li sitelen suwi. mi sona e ni: ona li sitelen sitelen._

#### personal style

If you think that you can't draw well enough to do this, don't worry. Just draw the image to your own ability and with your own style. It is not important that it looks like my drawing, just that it doesn't look like any of the other glyphs. As you learn them, you will see they can change quite a bit and still remain distinct from one another. It is also permissible to use a simplified version of the glyph that is still easily readable. It can be used when writing in small or tight spaces, or if you just want to make your drawn sentences pona mute.

#### slowing down

In a world of rapid and electronically-aided language, what you are about to learn contradicts common sense. This is not an efficient way to communicate, and it is quite impractical on a computer. So why would you want to learn how to do this at all?

This is a way to slow down and play with your thoughts. It is a tool to help connect your mind back to your hand. Just as toki pona examines how the _language_ you use to communicate can influence your thoughts, sitelen sitelen will let you explore how the _method_ you use to communicate can do the same.

I encourage you to follow along with these lessons, to learn how to read sitelen sitelen. But I also encourage you to try and draw along as well, as this is not just for artists but for everybody.  Email me copies of your drawings, Iâ€™ll be sure to put them into the gallery!

#### updated lessons (2020)

If you have known about the first half of these lessons for some time, and are just now returning, welcome back. Around the time jan Sonja was adding some new words to toki pona and finishing up _pu_, I left these lessons unfinished at lesson 9, not knowing if I would have to restructure them or change them entirely.

Since then, I have continuously received heartfelt emails where you have taken the time not only to study these lessons but also decifer from the few examples available what has been left unsaid. You have often also requested that I finish the lessons, and as toki pona has maintained and grown a community of people so positive in nature, I can't help but want to give back to it. So it is my pleasure to add again to these lessons and contribute in the best way that I can. I will continue to follow the lesson outline laid out by jan Pije, but am also looking for ways to integrate better with other lessons or differing positions on the grammar. Any suggestions are always welcome.
