> ### grammar review
>
>_The grammar in this lesson is covered by chapters 2-5 in [pu](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS), lesson 3 in [Pije](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona.php), and pages 1-3 in [Lantan](https://rnd.neocities.org/tokipona/)._
>
>Basic sentences in toki pona consist of two words. The first word is the subject _mi_ or _sina_. The second word is the entire predicate. It describes something about the subject, and can function as a verb, adjective, or noun.
>
>There are a lot of sentences in toki pona where what we call the verb in English is ambiguous or absent entirely. To say 'you are big' in toki pona, _sina suli_, there is no 'are'. It may be better to think of this second word as an action, quality, or state of being.
>
>Here are examples of each of these types of sentences:
>
>* __mi moku.__ - _[subject][action]._ - I eat.
>* __sina pona.__ - _[subject][quality]._ - You are good.
 >* __mi jan.__ - _[subject][state of being]._ - I am a person.
>
>Most of these simple predicates can operate in more than one of these capacities, changing the meaning of the sentence. Only context and common sense can be used to determine the most likely meaning:
>
>* __sina moku__ - _[subject][action]_ - You eat.
>* __sina moku__ - _[subject][quality]_ - You are like food.
 >* __sina moku__ - _[subject][state of being]_ - You are food.
>
>When the subject is anything other than _mi_ or _sina_, the particle _li_ separates the subject from the predicate.
>
>* __jan li moku__ - _[subject] li [verb]_ - the person eats.
>* __ona li jan__ - _[subject] li [noun]_ - he/she is a person / they are people.
>* __telo li pona__ - _[subject] li [verb]_ - water is good.
>
>When you see a sentence like _ona li jan_, do not think of _li_ as meaning _is_.  Think of it as a marker that indicates the end of the subject, and the beginning of something about that subject.

### sentences with mi or sina as the subject

#### vertical stacks, horizontal rows

With simple sentences of only two words, you have the choice to stack the glyphs, or place them side by side.

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_05.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_07.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="mi moku." %}

When building sentences, we work from top to bottom, and from left to right. Here are two examples of sentences built from the top down. The punctuation works as one more glyph in the stack.

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_01.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_02.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="mi pona." %}

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_03.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_04.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="sina suli." %}


#### placed in front, tucked behind

Don't be confused when one glyph appears _in front of_ or _tucked behind_ the other. This has more to do with legibility than word order. Notice in the examples above, mi is behind pona in mi pona, is resting on moku in the vertical mi moku, and is in front of moku in the horizontal mi moku. All of these variations are acceptable, and as you work through more complex sentences, you will start to notice situations where one looks better than another.

#### punctuation

Notice in both variations of mi moku, above, the period glyph runs horizontal along the bottom. This will always be the case. Punctuation marks at the end of sentences work like pedestals for the sentence block to rest upon.

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_09.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_10.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="sina pona." %}

Compare the two examples of sina pona, one with a period and one with an exclamation point.  For the end of sentences, all punctuation glyphs work in the same way.

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_11.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_12.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="sina pona!" %}

### sentences using li between the subject and predicate

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_13.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_14.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="telo li pona." %}

When the subject is other than _mi_ or _sina_, _li_ is located between the subject from the predicate. In sitelen sitelen, _li_ works by acting as a container. _li_ is nothing more than a line which runs out of the subject, and around the action or attribute in the predicate. Remember, down and to the right, so _li_ must follow this pattern:

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_15.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_16.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="suno li suli!" %}

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_17.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso03_18.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="jan li pona." %}
