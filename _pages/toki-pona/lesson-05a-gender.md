### negation

If you understood how modifiers worked (chapter 5) then negation shouldn't be too much trouble, since adding _ala_ to negate nouns or verbs follows the same block order rules.

If _ala_ modifies the subject, as in _jan ala_ (no one), it comes before _li_ as part of the head noun:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_02.jpg" caption="jan ala li sona." %}

To negate a verb, _ala_ comes directly after the verb.  And if it is modifying an action or a state of being infixed in _li_, so is _ala_:

### description with ala

With toki pona's limited vocabulary, using _ala_ it to modify adjectives becomes particularly powerful.  For example, _pona_ could potentially express cleanliness in context, but the exact meaning would be ambiguous. _jaki_, on the other hand comes much more limited in scope and _jaki ala_ would almost certainly be understood to mean clean, without dirt, etc.

-> tomo li jaki ala.
-> moko ni li suwi ala.
-> mi jo e wawa ala.

### ale / ali

There may be two ways to spell it, but only one glyph block for _ale/ali_. Just like the modifiers we have already seen, it follows normal block order rules.

### ante



### expressing new, another, more

There are two things to note when working with _sin_, one of which you may have already noticed if you have spend much time looking at [the syllabary](/toki-pona/dictionaries/syllabary/). The glyph for sin is the same as it's syllable equivalent, _si_ with a suffix of _n_.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.sin_versions %}

Take note again of the two variations of _i_ within the glyphs above, and remember that the syllabary presents the simplified version, but both are used interchangeably in the glyph as well as the syllable. Your choice will most likely be determined by how small of a space you are trying to fit it into.

The other thing to note about _sin_ is that it can naturally take on a rectangular proportion, something that we referred to as a short or thin block in [modifiers](/toki-pona/modifiers). As _sin_ is often used as a modifier, you will find comes in quite handy.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/gender/x.jpg" caption="seme li lon insa poki sin?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/gender/x.jpg" caption="jan sin li seme?" %}


### test your comprehension

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_13.jpg"
   caption="jan sonja li mama pi toki pona"
   reveal_text=true
%}

-> mi sona ala e toki sina. I don't understand you.
