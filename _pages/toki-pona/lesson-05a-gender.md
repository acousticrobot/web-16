>### grammar review
>_The grammar in this lesson is covered in chapters 2, 4 and 6 in [pu](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS), lessons 8 and 9 in [Pije](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona.php), and page 2 and 5 in [Lentan](https://rnd.neocities.org/tokipona/)._

> Besides _jan_ and _ona_, there are several words that can work as head nouns and be readily understood as referring to an individual, or a general or specific or group of people. The most common of these is: _meli_, _mije_, and the unofficial word _tonsi_. _kulupu_ works in this capacity as well, but always implies plurality.

### identity and plurality

One of the beautiful things about toki pona, in my opinion, is that gender and plurality tends to remain unspoken by default. Let's draw _he is good!_, _she is good!_, and finally _they are good!_

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.ona_examples %}

We can however express gender and plurality more explicitly if necessary.

#### gender

Besides _meli_ and _mije_ for man and woman, many in the toki pona community also employ _tonsi_ to express identity outside of the binary concept of gender. Like many words, they all can take on many roles in the sentence.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.gender_examples %}

#### plurality

To express more than one of anything we have already seen we can use mute as a modifier. This works with _mi_, _sina_ and _ona_ as well, to make _us_, _you-plural_, and _they_ explicit:

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.mute_examples %}

Additionally _kulupu_ is used regularly to talk about a community or group of people:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/gender/kulupumiliwawasuli.jpg" caption="kulupu mi li wawa suli." %}

#### mama

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.mama_examples %}

_mama_ is unusual in sitelen sitelen   in that there are two glyphs for one word. I've added a second glyph for [reasons explained more in depth here]({% post_url 2020-08-07-mi-ante-e-sitelen-tawa-nimi-mama %}). Although there has never been an inherent gender to _mama_, its use has expanded far beyond the examples present in texts when I was first learning toki pona.

The older glyph will always be here, it has historical precedent, and in some sentences it can actually add context.  The example sentence in _pu_ is a case in point. But by being figurative and _meli_, it comes loaded with additional pretext, and so I've added the second glyph for uses when one wants to free the image from these constraints.

### Inclusion and Exclusion

#### negation with ala

If you understand how modifiers work then negation shouldn't be too much trouble, since adding _ala_ to negate nouns or verbs follows the same block order rules.

If _ala_ modifies the subject, as in _jan ala_ (no one), it comes before _li_ as part of the head noun:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_02.jpg" caption="jan ala li sona." %}

To negate a verb, _ala_ comes directly after the verb.  And if it is modifying an action or a state of being infixed in _li_, so is _ala_:

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.ala_verb_examples %}

##### description with ala

With toki pona's limited vocabulary, using _ala_ it to modify adjectives becomes particularly powerful.  For example, _pona_ could potentially express cleanliness in context, but the exact meaning would be ambiguous. _jaki_, on the other hand comes much more limited in scope and _jaki ala_ would almost certainly be understood to mean clean, without dirt, etc.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.ala_description_examples %}

### ante

As a modifier, _ante_ can indicate the other, or another. It pairs well both implicitly and explicitly with ni.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.ante_examples %}

### inclusion

There may be two ways to spell it, but only one glyph block for _ale/ali_. Just like the modifiers we have already seen, it follows normal block order rules.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.ale_examples %}

#### expressing new, another, more

There are two things to note when working with _sin_, one of which you may have already noticed if you have spend much time looking at [the syllabary](/toki-pona/dictionaries/syllabary/). The glyph for sin is the same as it's syllable equivalent, _si_ with a suffix of _n_.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.sin_versions %}

Take note again of the two variations of _i_ within the glyphs above, and remember that the syllabary presents the simplified version, but both are used interchangeably in the glyph as well as the syllable. Your choice will most likely be determined by how small of a space you are trying to fit it into.

The other thing to note about _sin_ is that it can naturally take on a rectangular proportion, something that we referred to as a short or thin block in [modifiers](/toki-pona/modifiers). As _sin_ is often used as a modifier, you will find comes in quite handy.
