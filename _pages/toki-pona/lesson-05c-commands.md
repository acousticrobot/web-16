### commands

The different uses of _o_ in toki pona are clear cases on their own, but when combined with other rules can lead to some confusion. Lets start with simple commands starting with _o_ because they are really straight forward.  To use _o_ with commands, treat _o_ as a substitute for _sina_ and use the glyph with normal block structure rules.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_25.jpg" caption="o toki!" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_26.jpg" caption="o awen e mama!" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_27.jpg" caption="o kama tawa ma tomo Uluku." %}

In this way _o_ works similar to the first sentences we learned to draw with _mi_ or _sina_ as the subject.  _o_ operates in place of the subject, and the verb does not require _li_.

### o with a subject

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_28.jpg" caption="jan Epi o a!" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_29.jpg" caption="soweli Kuti o mu!" %}

When the sentence has a subject, _o_ functions as a container. The subject glyph and any cartouche attached to it all go within the _o_.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_30.jpg" caption="jan Enkitu o moku e moku ni. o moku e telo ni." %}

It is somewhat different from the containers we have see so far, because when we write the sentence out, the name comes before the _o_. This is an exception to the block order rules.

Later on we will see one one other container, _la_, that reverses the block order rules in this way. These exceptions shouldn't be too hard to get used to.  Just remember that the _o_ refers to this subject so the subject rests inside the _o_, just as prepsitions refer to the direct objects they contain.

### addressing People

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_31.jpg" caption="jan Niki o, mama meli li awen e sina." %}

When we are addressing others, but not giving direct orders, the grammar of the sentence is different.  Everything that comes after the _o_ is a complete sentence with its own subject.

The _o_ is still connected to the person who is being address, so this is what we infix in the _o_. then a comma is added between the o container and the rest of the sentence to make the separation more apparent.

Just as this comma isn't strictly necessary when writing out the toki pona, you can leave it out here too if need be.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso09_32.jpg" caption="jan lili mi o, jan Kikamesi li lon ma tomo Uluku." %}

I don't use this comma glyph as often as I might use a comma when writing, since much of the infixing we are doing serves to group the language just as a comma might.  Also without clauses, toki pona has relatively few uses for commas in general.  Feel free however to use this glyph in the middle of your sentence block structures if you need to break the glyphs up to create a pause or emphasize the block order.
