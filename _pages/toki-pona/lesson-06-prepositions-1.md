### prepositions work as containers, sometimes

If you know how to use prepositions in toki pona, then you've already done the hard part of this chapter. Preposition glyphs work like li or e, in that they
    are containers for the objects of the prepositions. The only new things here is that they can also appear as glyph blocks by themselves and they all have
    'heads' that can change orientation.

#### prepositional “heads”

Before we go any farther, it is important to become aware of the anatomy of the preposition glyphs. Each preposition can be thought of as having a 'head' attached to an expandable body.

#### head rotation

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_05.jpg" caption="mi tawa." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_06.jpg" caption="mi tawa." %}

It doesn't matter if the head rests on the left, right, top, or even the bottom. It will still be read the same. This allows greater flexibility in getting shapes to fit next to each other.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_08.jpg" caption="mi moku kepeken poki." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_07.jpg" caption="mi moku kepeken poki." %}

It doesn't matter if the head rests on the left, right, top, or even the bottom. It will still be read the same. This allows greater flexibility in getting shapes to fit next to each other.

### using  lon, tawa ,and  kepeken

#### working as regular glyph blocks

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_09.jpg" caption="mi lon e sina." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_11.jpg" caption="ona li jo e tomo tawa." %}

As you know, toki pona words often fit into more than one category. If prepositional words are acting as verbs, adjectives, etc. they behave like any other glyph block.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_10.jpg" caption="sina wile kepeken e ilo." %}

Just rotate the head of the glyph to the position where it is most legible. Often the best position will be over the side of the rest of the sentence block.

He we can see the top of _lon_ rotated out the left side of _mi lon e sina_ and the hand of _kepeken_ popping out under _sina_ in _sina wile kepeken e ilo._

#### working as prepositional containers

When glyph blocks are used as a preposition, they expand to surround the rest of the prepositional phrase. This includes all of the modifiers if there are any.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_12.jpg" caption="mi moku lon tomo mi." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_13.jpg" caption="mi lukin tawa kon." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_14.jpg" caption="mi moku kepeken ilo." %}

#### working as both verb and preposition

Glyph blocks also work as containers when they function as both a verb and preposition.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_15.jpg" caption="mi lon tomo mi." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_17.jpg" caption="mi tan ma lili." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_16.jpg" caption="mi tawa jan pona." %}

Again, the entire prepositional phrase fits into the prepositional glyph. In the next lesson, we will continue to work with prepositions, and look at the rest of the glyph block which have the ability to work in this manner.

### the colon

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_18.jpg" caption="sina toki e ni: kon tawa li lon." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_19.jpg" caption="mi wile e ni: mi tawa tomo mi." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso06_20.jpg" caption="ona li len tan ni: ona li wile e seli." %}

The only other thing we need to cover in this lesson is the colon. Just like the period, the colon is a horizontal bar that the glyph blocks rest upon. In this case though, it is sandwiched between the two sentence fragments.
