> Besides _jan_ and _ona_, there are several words that can work as head nouns and be readily understood as referring to an individual, or a general or specific or group of people. The most common of these is: _meli_, _mije_, and the unofficial word _tonsi_. _kulupu_ works in this capacity as well, but always implies plurality.

### identity and plurality

One of the beautiful things about toki pona, in my opinion, is that gender and plurality tends to remain unspoken by default. Let's draw _he is good!_, _she is good!_, and finally _they are good!_

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.ona_examples %}

We can however express gender and plurality more explicitly if necessary.

#### gender

Besides _meli_ and _mije_ for man and woman, many in the toki pona community also employ _tonsi_ to express identity outside of the binary concept of gender. Like many words, they all can take on many roles in the sentence.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.gender_examples %}

#### plurality

To express more than one of anything we have already seen we can use mute as a modifier. This works with _mi_, _sina_ and _ona_ as well, to make _us_, _you-plural_, and _they_ explicit:

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.mute_examples %}

Additionally _kulupu_ is used regularly to talk about a community or group of people:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/gender/kulupumiliwawasuli.jpg" caption="kulupu mi li wawa suli." %}

#### mama

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.mama_examples %}

_mama_ is unusual in sitelen sitelen   in that there are two glyphs for one word. I've added a second glyph for [reasons explained more in depth here]({% post_url 2020-08-07-mi-ante-e-sitelen-tawa-nimi-mama %}). Although there has never been an inherent gender to _mama_, its use has expanded far beyond the examples present in texts when I was first learning toki pona.

The older glyph will always be here, it has historical precedent, and in some sentences it can actually add context.  The example sentence in _pu_ is a case in point. But by being figurative and _meli_, it comes loaded with additional pretext, and so I've added the second glyph for uses when one wants to free the image from these constraints.
