### yes / no questions

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_09.jpg" caption="jan li jo ala jo e wawa?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_08.jpg" caption="ni li musi ala musi?" %}

Just as in Chinese, toki pona has the verb-not-verb structure for yes/no questions. Most of the time ala used in this way will behave normally.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_07.jpg" caption="ona li pali ala pali?" %}

The only thing new here is the question mark glyph block is used instead of a period.

#### questions in the four-block structure

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_10.jpg" caption="sina pona ala pona?" %}

However, if you create a four block structure with the subject-verb-ala-verb, there is an exception to our block order rules:

The four block are grouped in what would really be a clockwise arrangement.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_12.jpg" caption="sina sona ala sona e ni: mi jo e wawa?!" %}


{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_11.jpg" caption="mi ken ala ken toki?" %}

The reason for this is to avoid doubling the same verb glyph next to itself. This way they remain separated by ala.

Think of the entire group as one single block with the subject and ala in two opposite corners, and the repeated verb in the other two corners. The 'X' shape in the middle of ala echoes this structure.
