### Questions using seme

There isn't anything really difficult to learn about forming questions. As long as you learned what the question mark looks like in [lesson 8](/toki-pona/lesson-8/), and you know how to use seme in toki pona grammar, you only need to learn the glyph for _seme_ and you are set to go:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_01.jpg" caption="seme?" %}

The important thing to remember is that _seme_ often takes the place of the part of the sentence in question. If you are asking who or what did something, _seme_ will probably take place of the subject:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_02.jpg" caption="seme li lape lon supa?" %}

When asking what was done, seme takes the place of the verb

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_04.jpg" caption="sina seme e ona?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_05.jpg" caption="ona li seme e sina?" %}

When you are asking what something is, _seme_ will be infixed in _li_:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_06.jpg" caption="pipi suwi li seme?" %}

And when asking who or what was acted upon, _seme_ will most likely take the place of the direct object, infixed in _e_:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_07.jpg" caption="ona li olin e seme?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_08.jpg" caption="sina lukin e seme?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_09.jpg" caption="jan nasa li pali e seme?" %}

Additionally, _seme_ can take the place of an adjective when asking which one(s)


{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_10.jpg" caption="kili seme li suwi?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_11.jpg" caption="mi mute li wile tawa tomo seme?" %}

### asking why with tan seme

To ask why in toki pona, we use _tan seme_.  Remember from [lesson 6](/toki-pona/lesson-6/) that _tan_ is a preposition, and thus a container, so _seme_ naturally sits inside. One further simplification however is allowed:

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_12.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_12b.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="tan seme" %}

There is nothing grammatically wrong when we surround _seme_ within tan, but sometimes the double line draws too much unnecessary attention. By enlarging _seme_ slightly we fill the entirety of _tan_ , effectively combine the two glyphs.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_13.jpg" caption="sina olin e ona tan seme?" %}

### questions with other prepositions

This simplification carries over to our other prepositions as well. To be sure there is no requirement _seme_ be combined when surrounded by a preposition.  But if you compare the two glyph blocks below, you can see in the second one, when we join _tawa_ and _seme_, it aids in readability:

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_14.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_15.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="tomo tawa li tawa seme?" %}

Here are two further examples with _lon_, _kepeken_, and _sama_:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_16.jpg" caption="sina li lon seme?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_17.jpg" caption="mi pakala kepeken seme?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_17c.jpg" caption="jan ni li sama seme?" %}

When _seme_ is modifying something else within a preposition, we follow normal block order rules:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_18.jpg" caption="jan utala li tan ma seme?" %}

### expressing new, another, more

There are two things to note when working with _sin_, one of which you may have already noticed if you have spend much time looking at [the syllabary](/toki-pona/dictionaries/syllabary/). The glyph for sin is the same as it's syllable equivalent, _si_ with a suffix of _n_.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.sin_versions %}

Take note again of the two variations of _i_ within the glyphs above, and remember from [lesson 2](/toki-pona/lesson-2/) that the syllabary presents the simplified version, but both are used interchangeably in the glyph as well as the syllable. Your choice will most likely be determined by how small of a space you are trying to fit it into.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_03.jpg" caption="seme li sin?" %}

The other thing to note about _sin_ is that it can naturally take on a rectangular proportion, something that we referred to as a short or thin block in [lesson 5](/toki-pona/lesson-5/). As _sin_ is often used as a modifier, you will find comes in quite handy.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_19.jpg" caption="seme li lon insa poki sin?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_20.jpg" caption="jan sin li seme?" %}
