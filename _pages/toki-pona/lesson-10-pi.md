### descriptive groupings with pi

Despite the relatively simple rules around its usage, when and how to use pi effectively is one of the most complicated aspects of speaking toki pona. Similarly when drawing sitelen sitelen, the use and placement of pi will take some practice.  It is complicated enough that whenever I am laying out a glyph block with pi in it, I often start within pi and then work my way out.

#### orientation

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.pi_versions %}

Anatomically, the _pi_ glyph is derived from the syllable _pi_, sticking it's head up, emptied of contents, and ready to take on it's role as a container. Once employed, it's head stretches out like a goose's neck, and rests next to the first group of glyphs. There are three common orientations for this goose neck: up and to the left, up and to the right, or left and down along the bottom.

#### common groupings

Like _li_ and _e_, _pi_ operates as a container to group other glyphs. Use of _pi_ in toki pona almost always results in at least two glyphs within, and most commonly either one or two glyphs above. Unique to _pi_ is the notion that the group of glyphs that operate as one unit includes a number of glyphs right before the _pi_ as well. This entire grouping can then be found anywhere within a sentence that you could place a single glyph acting as a noun.

 {% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_03.jpg" caption="kulupu pi toki pona" %}
 {% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_04.jpg" caption="jan mute pi ma tomo" %}
 {% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_05.jpg" caption="jan suli pi nasin musi" %}

Once this grouping feels satisfactory, it's time to fit it into the larger glyph block:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_06.jpg" caption="mi tawa tomo pi telo nasa." %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_07.jpg" caption="jan lawa pi tomo tawa kon li tawa sewi." %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_08.jpg" caption="mi kama sona e nasin pona pi seli moku." %}

Depending on the fit, you may find you need to start again with one of the other orientations and build it back up from inside the _pi_ on out.

### possessives with pi

Structurally, possessives with pi operate in the same way:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_09.jpg" caption="nimi pi mama mije li seme?" %}

The only time you may find a single glyph innside of pi is with the _li pi_ formation:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_10.jpg" caption="kalama musi ni li pi mi." %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_11.jpg" caption="ilo ni li pi sina." %}

### opposites with pi and ala

Using _ala_ within _pi_ to express _the opposite of_ also works as you would expect:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_12.jpg" caption="jan lawa pi kulupu utala li jan pi lape ala." %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_13.jpg" caption="jan pi tomo ala li tawa mute." %}

### more than one pi

One of the initial temptations when learning toki pona is to try and distinguish the object you are describing from all other similar things. Raccoon becomes "night dirt eating animal of front hand feet" and you still haven't ruled out the Opossum or Coati. Once you have more than one pi it's often a sign that you are overloading your subject, and having to nest multiple _pi_ containers will probably be more than enough help you put and end to that.

But every once in a while it can't be helped, especially when working both with a possessive and descriptive grouping:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso11_14.jpg" caption="len pi jan pi lon anpa ma li jaki." %}

The best thing to do is to first establish how much space you need in order to draw the innermost glyphs. If you start working from the subject down to the period, you are almost assured of hitting a point where it is simply to tight inside the second nested pi.

The other thing to do is to try several orientations for both goose necks, and try and vary the orientations for better visual flow.

### pi in the wild

I encourage you to search out uses of pi in sitelen sitelen by myself and others to get a good sense of how it works when found within larger sitelen blocks. One good place to look is [lipu lawa pi esun kama]({% post_url 2012-08-02-lipu-lawa-pi-esun-kama %}) which contains 15 _pi_ glyphs in total, including a nested pair and one used in linear isolation.  Take a look at this altered image which highlights all of them, and then take another look at the original and see if you can spot them in the crowd.
