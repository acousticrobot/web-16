### questions using seme

There isn't anything really difficult to learn about forming questions, as long as you learned what the question mark looks like in lesson 8, and you know how to use seme in toki pona grammar, you really only need to learn the glyph and you are set to go:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_x.jpg" caption="seme?" %}

The important think to remember is that _seme_ is often taking place of the part of the sentence in question. If the question begs who or what did something then _seme_ most likely takes the place of the subject:

- seme li lape lon supa?
- seme li sin?

When you are asking what something is _seme_ will be infixed in _li_:

- soweli suwi ni li seme?

And when asking who or what was acted upon, seme will most likely be infixed in _e_ or a preposition:

- ona li olin e seme?
- sina li pali e seme?

Additionally, seme can take the place of an adjective when asking which one(s)

- kili seme li suwi?
- mi mute li wile tawa tomo seme?

### asking why?

- tan seme -> tanseme

- sina olin e ona tan seme?

### questions with other prepositions

- sina pali kepeken seme?
- sina li lon seme?
- tomo tawa li tawa seme?


- soweli suli Kowala li tan ma seme?


### expressing new, another, more
