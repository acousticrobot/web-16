### Questions using seme

There isn't anything really difficult to learn about forming questions. As long as you learned what the question mark looks like in lesson 8, and you know how to use seme in toki pona grammar, you only need to learn the glyph for _seme_ and you are set to go:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso10_01.jpg" caption="seme?" %}

The important think to remember is that _seme_ often takes the place of the part of the sentence in question. If you are asking who or what did something, _seme_ will probably take place of the subject:

- seme li lape lon supa?
- seme li sin?

When you are asking what something is, _seme_ will be infixed in _li_:

- soweli suwi ni li seme?

And when asking who or what was acted upon, seme will most likely take the place of the direct object, infixed in _e_:

- ona li olin e seme?
- sina li lukin e seme?
- sina pali lon tenpo seme?

Additionally, seme can take the place of an adjective when asking which one(s)

- kili seme li suwi?
- mi mute li wile tawa tomo seme?

### asking why?

To ask why in toki pona, we use _tan seme_.  Remember from lesson 6 that _tan_ is a preposition, and thus a container, so seme naturally sits inside. One further simplification however is allowed:

- tan seme -> tanseme

There is nothing grammatically wrong when we surround seme within tan, but purely aesthetically, the double line draws too much attention to that part of the glyph. By enlarging _seme_ slightly we fill the entirety of _tan_ , effectively combine the two glyphs.

- sina olin e ona tan seme?

### questions with other prepositions

This simplification can carry over to our other prepositions as well:

- sina li lon seme?
- tomo tawa li tawa seme?
- sina pali kepeken seme?

When seme is modifying something else within _tan_ however, it works best to follow normal block order rules:

- soweli suli Kowala li tan ma seme?


### expressing new, another, more

There are two things to note when working with _sin_, one of which you may have already noticed if you have spend much time looking at [the syllabary](/toki-pona/dictionaries/syllabary/). The glyph for sin is the same as it's syllable equivalent, _si_ with a suffix of _n_.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.sin_versions %}

I didn't want to distract from the last lesson when learning how to work with syllables, but do take note of the two versions of _i_ within the glyphs above. The syllabary presents the simplified version but both are used interchangeably. Your choice will most likely be determined by how small of a space you are trying to fit it into.

The other think to note about _sin_ is that is has a preferred orientation, something that we referred to as a short glyph in [lesson 5](/toki-pona/lesson-5/). As sin is mostly used as a modifier, this again you will find comes in quite handy.

 - seme li lon poki sin?
 - jan sin li seme?

### Further insight

As jan Pije says in lesson 10, congratulations! And better yet, welcome back if you have known about the first half of these lessons for some time. Even though we are just over the half-way point of the toki pona lessons, you have enough insight into sitelen sitelen at this point that you could just infer the rest of the rules without much trouble. In fact around the time jan Sonja was adding some new words to toki pona and finishing up _pu_, I left these lessons unfinished at lesson 9, not knowing if I would have to restructure them or change them entirely. After that point, I have continuously received heartfelt emails where you have taken the time not only to study these lessons but also decifer from the few examples available what has been left unsaid. Since then, toki pona has shown such an endurance and continued to grow a community of people so positive in nature that I can't help but want to give back to it. So it is my pleasure to continue these lessons and contribute in the best way that I can. Any suggestions are always welcome.

jan pona mi o pilin pona! sina li kama sona e sitelen sona mute.  tenpo pini mute la mi pini e lipu kama sona pi sitelen sitelen. sina mute li kama jo e sona li sewi e kon sitelen sitelen. mi pilin pona tan pali sina la mi wile mute e lipu pi sitelen sona.  kepeken toki pona la mi ken ala toki e ni: mi olin e toki pona anu olin e sitelen sitelen. taso mi ken ala toki e ni: mi olin e sina mute. seme li pona anu ike tawa sina la, o toke e mi. mi open.
