### interjections o and mu

_a_ and _mu_ function as normal blocks, but their special grammatical usage means they can appear in interesting places throughout the sentence blocks.  They are both quite recognizable logograms and their meaning is quite interpretive, so don't be afraid to be creative in the way you use them.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.interjection_examples %}

### using o

The different uses of _o_ in toki pona are clear cases on their own, but when combined they can lead to multiple possibilities. You ultimately have a lot of flexibility in how to use _o_ in your glyphs, and understanding the options will help you pick the most appropriate one for the context.

#### inline block

The most simple option is to use the _o_ glyph with normal block structure rules. Just remember this is always an option for any glyph in any context, to simply revert to inline block rules.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.inline_block_examples %}

When giving a command an inline _o_ works similar to the first sentences we learned to draw with _mi_ or _sina_ as the subject. Think of _o_ as operating in place of the subject.

#### o as a predicate container

Another option is to use _o_ as a container for the predicate.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.o_as_predicate_container_examples %}

When operating as a container for the predicate, you can think of _o_ as following the same block order rules as _li_.

#### o as a subject container

The third option, when addressing someone, is to use _o_ as a container for the subject. The subject glyph, including a cartouche if present, all go within the _o_.

It is different from the containers we have see so far since _o_ is containing the glyphs that come before it.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.o_as_subject_container_examples %}

<!-- Later on we will see one one other container, _la_, that reverses the block order rules in this way. These exceptions shouldn't be too hard to get used to.  Just remember that the _o_ refers to this subject so the subject rests inside the _o_, just as prepositions refer to the direct objects they contain.
 -->

### choosing how to use o

#### addressing the subject

When we are addressing others, but not giving direct orders, _o_ as a subject container works well.

The _o_ is still connected to the person who is being address, so this is what we infix in the _o_. Everything that comes after the _o_ is a complete sentence with its own subject, and can follow the normal block order rules.

When used this way, it is often not necessary to include a comma.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.addressing_subject_examples %} 

#### addressing and giving commands

When both addressing someone by name while giving a command, _o_ fulfills two roles, and the predicate container often feels like the more natural choice

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.addressing_and_giving_commands_examples %}

### no strict container rules

With the many roles that _o_ can play, I have found that absolute rules about when to choose which option don't always work well. Just like so many things in toki pona, context matters, and should be your ultimate guide.  

For instance, look at these two examples. They both translate to _jan Ome o toki!_ but which one would you use for "Hi Ome!" and which for "Talk Ome!"? My choices are in the practice examples below.
