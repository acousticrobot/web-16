> _o_ is a particle that has three use cases.  The first is after the subject to get their attention. Note that this can be considered a complete sentence in itself.

>* __jan Piku o__! - hey Piku!
>
>The second use is at the start of a sentence. It take the place of the subject and implies a command.
>
>* __o awen e mi!__ - wait for me!
>
>The third case combines the last two, effectively taking the place of _li_. It also could be seen as softening the tone to that of a request.

### interjections o and mu

_a_ and _mu_ function as normal blocks, but their special grammatical usage means they can appear in interesting places throughout the sentence blocks.  They are both quite recognizable logograms, so don't be afraid to extend their creative grammatical possibilities to the way you use them.

IMAGE_TODO: interjection_examples: 
  * aaa
  * mu!
{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.interjection_examples %}

### using o

The different uses of _o_ in toki pona are clear cases on their own, but when combined they can lead to multiple possibilities. You ultimately have a lot of flexibility in how to use _o_ in your glyphs, and understanding the options will help you pick the most appropriate one for the context.

#### inline block

To use _o_ with commands, the most simple option is to use the glyph with normal block structure rules.

IMAGE_TODO: inline_o_examples: 
  * o toki!
  * o moku!
{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.inline_o_examples %}

In this way _o_ works similar to the first sentences we learned to draw with _mi_ or _sina_ as the subject and without _li_ before the verb. In this case _o_ operates in place of the subject.

#### o as a subject container

When addressing someone, _o_ can function as a container. The subject glyph, including a cartouche if present, all go within the _o_.

It is somewhat different from the containers we have see so far since linearly the name comes before the _o_. This is an exception to the block order rules we have seen so far.

IMAGE_TODO: subject_o_examples: 
  * jan ami o
{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.subject_o_examples %}

<!-- Later on we will see one one other container, _la_, that reverses the block order rules in this way. These exceptions shouldn't be too hard to get used to.  Just remember that the _o_ refers to this subject so the subject rests inside the _o_, just as prepositions refer to the direct objects they contain.
 -->

##### addressing people

When we are addressing others, but not giving direct orders, _o_ as a subject container also works well.

The _o_ is still connected to the person who is being address, so this is what we infix in the _o_. then a comma is added between the o container and the rest of the sentence to make the separation more apparent. Everything that comes after the _o_ is a complete sentence with its own subject, and can follow the normal block order rules.

IMAGE_TODO: 
  * jan ami o, mi awen e sina

Just as this comma isn't strictly necessary when writing out the toki pona, you can leave it out here too if you choose.

IMAGE_TODO: 
  * jan ami o ilo li pakala.

#### o as a predicate container

A third option is to use _o_ as a container for the predicate, similar to _li_:

When both addressing someone by name while giving a command, _o_ fulfills two roles, and often this feels like the more natural choice

IMAGE_TODO: predicate_o_examples: 
  * jan ami o awen e mi 
  *  soweli o mu!
{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.subject_o_examples %}

### no strict container rules

With the many roles that _o_ can play, I have found that absolute rules about when to choose which option don't always work well. Just like so many things in toki pona, context matters, and should be your ultimate guide.  

For instance, look at these two examples. They both translate to _jan Ami o toki!_ but which one would you use for "Hi Ami!" and which for "Talk Ami!"? My choices are in the practice examples below.

  * jan ami o toki
  * jan ami o toki
