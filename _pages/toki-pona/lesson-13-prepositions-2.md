>The most common directions relative to one's location can be described with _sewi, anpa, sinpin, mosi, insa, and poka_. This list is by no means an exhaustive. _pu_ uses _noka_ instead of _anpa_, and in context many other words can make sense to describe location, and many other ways to describe movement and direction. One word to keep in mind is _weka_.

### using sama, tan, and poka

We already took a look at lon, tawa, and tan in the last lesson, but there's still a little more to cover on prepositions. First let's review what we already know with a few more examples. Remember, each preposition can be thought of as having a 'head' attached to an expandable body.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.prepositions %}

#### working as regular glyph blocks

If they aren't being used as part of a prepositional phrase, they act like normal stacking glyph blocks.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.regular_blocks %}

In _len mute li sama_, there is no object to fill _sama_. In _tan ni li nasa_, _tan_ is part of the subject "the reason".  This works the same for _poka_, when it is used as a noun:

#### working as prepositional containers

When one of these glyph blocks function as a preposition, or as a combination verb and preposition, they become a container for the rest of the prepositional phrase. The head portion of the glyph can be oriented anywhere is isn’t obstructing the rest of the glyphs.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.preposition_examples %}

#### using prepositions with li

One thing we haven't covered yet is what to do when your verb is inside of li. Look again at _ona li lukin sama mi_ up above. The verb, lukin, becomes an infix in li, and mi becomes an infix in _sama_. But what if the preposition is also the verb? We end up with a double infix.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso07_10.jpg" caption="ona li lon tomo ona." %}

First the preposition fits into the _li_ container. Then, the object of the preposition and all of the modifiers go inside the preposition glyph.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/prepositions/mulitansoweli.jpg" caption="mu li tan soweli ni." %}

You can try drawing the whole unit from the inside out, and even drawing the rest of the sentence after this block has been composed. I usually find I have to try a couple times until I find a composition I’m satisfied with.

#### using pre-verbs

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.verb_phrases %}

What if we want to use a verb/preposition in combination with _wile_? Since the preposition is part of the verb, the whole thing gets infixed into _li_.

Let's look at _ona li wile tawa tomo ona kepeken tomo tawa_, "he wants to drive home" (literally: he wants to go to his house using the car). If you can understand how this works then you probably have a good understanding of how to use preposition glyphs.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso07_15.jpg" caption="ona li wile tawa tomo ona kepeken tomo tawa." %}

The first prepositional phrase: _towards his house--tawa tomo ona_ is also part of the verb wile tawa, so it all goes _inside_ of li.

The second prepositional phrase _using the car--kepeken tomo tawa_ is not part of the verb, so it goes _outside_ of the li.

You may be thinking this is a whole other thing you have to think about that doesn't come up when you are just writing in toki pona. When you can draw it out though, you will have a much better understanding of how you are using each of these prepositions in each sentence because you will have to know when they are verbs, when they are prepositions, and when they are modifiers. This in turn will help you write much better in toki pona.

It also has the advantage of disambiguating things that might have more that one reading when written linearly.

### directional nouns

_anpa_, _insa_, _monsi_, _sewi_, and _poka_, or directional nouns as jan Sonja calls them in _pu_, are used with prepositions to indicate direction. I am quite used to using _anpa_ in some cases where Sonja uses _noka_, but they all operate identically:

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.directional_nouns %}

Since these words aren't true prepositions, they need one of the prepositions we have discussed so far to complete the prepositional phrase. Because of this they end up acting as part of the infix to the preposition.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.directional_nouns_2 %}

You may have wondered up to now why the glyph block for li was so boring. Now you can see just how much work it has to do at times. If it were any more complex it would be hard to stuff all those pre-verbs and verb prepositions inside.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.directional_nouns_3 %}

Just as the prepositions have a head and body, often the subject of the sentence becomes the head and li becomes the body.
