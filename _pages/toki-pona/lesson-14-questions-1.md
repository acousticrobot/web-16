>_The grammar in this lesson is covered in chapter 7 in [pu](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS), lesson 8 in [Pije](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona.php), and page 7 in [Lentan](https://rnd.neocities.org/tokipona/)._

>Questions with a yes/no response in toki pona have a special grammatical structure. The word in question is repeated twice with _ala_ in between. The repeated word is generally constrained to the [action/quality/state of being] or a pre-verb, even if that word is also acting in another capacity such as a preposition.
>
>* __sina pali ala pali?__ - _[subj][action] ala [action]?_ - are you working?
>* __soweli li tan ala tan kasi suli?__ - _[subj] li [action/prep-head] ala [action/prep-head][prep-obj]?_ - Did the animal come from the woods?
>* __moku li suwi ala suwi__ - _[subj] li [quality] ala [quality]?_ - Is the food tasty?
>
> To answer, the target word is repeated by itself to answer yes, or with _ala_ for no.
>
>* __pali.__ - Yes (I am working).
>* __tan ala.__ - No (not from the woods).
>* __suwi.__ - Yes (it's good tasting).
>
> I say above _generally_ constrained. In _pu_ the structure is described solely with the word acting as the verb, but this is also before pre-verbs are introduced.  jan Pije and jan Lantan do not describe any limitations to it's use. My impression is if there is a pre-verb this is often the preferable word to target:
>
>* __sina wile ala wile moku__ - Do you [want/ not want] to eat?
>* __sina wile moku ala moku__ - Do you want to [eat/not eat]?
>
>The later makes one option appear to be "Do you want to not eat?" rather than "Don't you want to eat?"

### yes / no questions

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.yes_no %}

Just as in Chinese, toki pona has the verb-not-verb structure for yes/no questions. Most of the time ala used in this way will behave normally.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_07.jpg" caption="ona li pali ala pali?" %}

The only thing new here is the question mark glyph block is used instead of a period.

#### questions in the four-block structure

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso08_10.jpg" caption="sina pona ala pona?" %}

However, if you create a four block structure with the subject-verb-ala-verb, there is an exception to our block order rules:

The four block are grouped in what would really be a clockwise arrangement.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.four_block %}

The reason for this is to avoid doubling the same verb glyph next to itself. This way they remain separated by ala.

Think of the entire group as one single block with the subject and ala in two opposite corners, and the repeated verb in the other two corners. The 'X' shape in the middle of ala echoes this structure.
