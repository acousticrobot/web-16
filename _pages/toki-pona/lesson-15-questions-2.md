### Questions using seme

There isn't anything really difficult to learn about forming questions. As long as you learned what the question mark looks like in [the last lesson](/toki-pona/questions-1), and you know how to use seme in toki pona grammar, you only need to learn the glyph for _seme_ and you are set to go:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_01.jpg" caption="seme?" %}

The important thing to remember is that _seme_ often takes the place of the part of the sentence in question. If you are asking who or what did something, _seme_ will probably take place of the subject:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_02.jpg" caption="seme li lape lon supa?" %}

When asking what was done, seme takes the place of the verb

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_04.jpg" caption="sina seme e ona?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_05.jpg" caption="ona li seme e sina?" %}

When you are asking what something is, _seme_ will be infixed in _li_:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_06.jpg" caption="pipi suwi li seme?" %}

And when asking who or what was acted upon, _seme_ will most likely take the place of the direct object, infixed in _e_:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_07.jpg" caption="ona li olin e seme?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_08.jpg" caption="sina lukin e seme?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_09.jpg" caption="jan nasa li pali e seme?" %}

Additionally, _seme_ can take the place of an adjective when asking which one(s)


{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_10.jpg" caption="kili seme li suwi?" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_11.jpg" caption="mi mute li wile tawa tomo seme?" %}

### asking why with tan seme

To ask why in toki pona, we use _tan seme_.  Remember from [lesson 6](/toki-pona/lesson-6/) that _tan_ is a preposition, and thus a container, so _seme_ naturally sits inside. One further simplification however is allowed:

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_12.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_12b.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="tan seme" %}

There is nothing grammatically wrong when we surround _seme_ within tan, but sometimes the double line draws too much unnecessary attention. By enlarging _seme_ slightly we fill the entirety of _tan_ , effectively combine the two glyphs.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_13.jpg" caption="sina olin e ona tan seme?" %}

### questions with other prepositions

This simplification carries over to our other prepositions as well. To be sure there is no requirement _seme_ be combined when surrounded by a preposition.  But if you compare the two glyph blocks below, you can see in the second one, when we join _tawa_ and _seme_, it aids in readability:

{% assign image_set="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_14.jpg|/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_15.jpg" | split: "|" %}
{% include image_and_caption.html image=image_set caption="tomo tawa li tawa seme?" %}

Here are two further examples with _lon_, _kepeken_, and _sama_:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_16.jpg" caption="sina lon seme?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_17.jpg" caption="mi pakala kepeken seme?" %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_17c.jpg" caption="jan ni li sama seme?" %}

When _seme_ is modifying something else within a preposition, we follow normal block order rules:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/t47_kaso10_18.jpg" caption="jan utala li tan ma seme?" %}
