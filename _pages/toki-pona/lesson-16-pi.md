>the particle _pi_ is used to regroup modifiers.  It requires a minimum of one head noun and two modifiers.
>
>_pi_ is inserted between the head noun and the two modifiers.  This indicates that the second modifier modifies the first modifier before the meaning is used to modify the head noun. It is particularly useful when the head noun and first modifier have a meaning unto themselves:
>
>* __ma tomo mi__ - [ma tomo][mi] -> my city
>* ma pi tomo mi - [ma]pi[tomo mi] -> the land (of/around/associated with) my house
>
> When you see a noun group with _pi_, do not think of li as meaning _of_. Think of it as a marker that indicates the end of the head noun, and the beginning of a modifier applied to the head. Figure out the meaning of each half first, and then combine these into a one.
>
> Note that jan Pije also describes _pi_ as a possessive. This is generally not an accepted use case, especially with a single word after pi. You can avoid this pattern by repeating the head noun, or replacing the subject with _ni_:
>
>* _ike:_ ilo ni li pi sina. -> _pona:_ __ni li ilo sina.__
>* _ike:_ kalama musi ni li pi mi. -> _pona:_ __kalama musi ni li kalama mi.__

### descriptive groupings with pi

Despite the relatively simple rules around its usage, when and how to use pi effectively is one of the most complicated aspects of speaking toki pona. Similarly when drawing sitelen sitelen, the use and placement of pi will take some practice.  It is complicated enough that whenever I am laying out a glyph block with pi in it, I often start within pi and then work my way out.

#### orientation

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.pi_versions %}

Anatomically, the _pi_ glyph is derived from the syllable _pi_, sticking it's head up, emptied of contents, and ready to take on it's role as a container. Once employed, it's head stretches out like a goose's neck, and rests next to the first group of glyphs. There are three common orientations for this goose neck: up and to the left, up and to the right, or left and down along the bottom.

#### common groupings

Like _li_ and _e_, _pi_ operates as a container to group other glyphs. Use of _pi_ in toki pona almost always results in at least two glyphs within, and most commonly either one or two glyphs above. Unique to _pi_ is the notion that the group of glyphs that operate as one unit includes a number of glyphs right before the _pi_ as well. This entire grouping can then be found anywhere within a sentence that you could place a single glyph acting as a noun.

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.common_groupings %}

Once this grouping feels satisfactory, it's time to fit it into the larger glyph block:

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.common_groupings_blocks %}
{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.common_groupings_blocks_2 %}

Depending on the fit, you may find you need to start again with one of the other orientations and build it back up from inside the _pi_ on out.

### opposites with pi and ala

Using _ala_ within _pi_ to express _the opposite of_ also works as you would expect:

{% include image_dictionary.html definitions=page.pi_ala %}

### more than one pi

One of the initial temptations when learning toki pona is to try and distinguish the object you are describing from all other similar things. Raccoon becomes "night dirt eating animal of front hand feet" and you still haven't ruled out the Opossum or Coati. Once you have more than one pi it's often a sign that you are overloading your subject, and having to nest multiple _pi_ containers will probably be more than enough help you put and end to that.

But every once in a while it can't be helped:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/pi/t47_kaso11_14.jpg" caption="len pi jan pi lon anpa ma li jaki." %}

The best thing to do is to first establish how much space you need in order to draw the innermost glyphs. If you start working from the subject down to the period, you are almost assured of hitting a point where it is simply to tight inside the second nested pi.

The other thing to do is to try several orientations for both goose necks, and try and vary the orientations for better visual flow.

### pi in the wild

I encourage you to search out uses of pi in sitelen sitelen by myself and others to get a good sense of how it works when found within larger sitelen blocks. One good place to look is [lipu lawa pi esun kama]({% post_url 2012-08-02-lipu-lawa-pi-esun-kama %}) which contains 15 _pi_ glyphs in total, including a nested pair and one used in linear isolation.  Take a look at this altered image which highlights all of them, and then take another look at the original and see if you can spot them in the crowd.
