### the colon

The only sitelen sitelen related that we need to cover in this lesson is the colon. Just like the period, the colon is a horizontal bar that the glyph blocks rest upon. In this case though, it is sandwiched between the two sentence fragments.

### talking 'about' something

Even though this is a little niche, I have isolated the topic of topics to one lesson, since it bears a little concentration.

If we were to try and translate the English word 'about' literally in toki pona, we would get some pretty strange sentence. For just one example 'I am about to start' could be most literally 'mi lon poka tenpo open' but this is pretty _nasa_, and most likely not understandable. _turn about face_, _run about in circles_, _animals about the woods_, chances are if you are a native English speaker you should try and rephrase any sentence with about about it before you go about translating it, if you get what I'm going on about.

The most vexing example of this is when introducing a topic of conversation. There is no toki pona equivalent of about when talking _about_ something, and unfortunately no single convention to follow, despite the frequency of it's use. The solutions vary, and you need to have all of the lessons so far under your belt just to run through them all.  Let's order them in the same way we've encountered these structures through the lessons.


### topics of conversation as modifiers

pro: very succinct.

The problem with this is that so many of the toki pona words are legitimate modifiers for _toki_. _mi toki sitelen_: I use written communication. _mi toki ilo_: I am a telephone. _mi toki soweli_: mi mu.

### topics of conversation with e

I really like the [section of jan Lentan's lessons](https://rnd.neocities.org/tokipona/4.html) that introduces this convention so I want to include an example here. He describes using _toki e_ as a way presenting what is being talked about as a direct object.

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47_tokipona/kamasona/direct_objects/onalitokesi.jpg" caption="ona li toki e sitelen." %}

Here the _e_ separates toki and sitelen to clarify that 'they talk _about_ writing/drawing'.

### Using _e ni:_

Remember _e ni:_
