toki pona is a philosophically minimalist constructed language, created by Sonja Lang.  Versions of it first appeared on line in 2001, and a small but dedicated community of speakers developed around it in the 2000's, mostly around a handful of resources that were linked from her website.  In 2009, Sonja began to develop a formal lesson plan, which was published in 2014.

Many others have written better than I could about the language, it's history and use, so I will not attempt to repeat their work here. My interest here is to keep a list of resources here for others looking to lean

#### Learning Courses

If you know you want to learn toki pona, [Toki Pona The Language of Good](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS?tag=duckduckgo-exp-b-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1), the official toki pona book, is a must own.  The examples are simple, easy to understand, and used as a standard to judge all other resources by.

There are a number of lessons on line as well, each with it's own advantages.

[jan Pije's lessons](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/learn.php), once the authoritative source for learning toki pona, is still a great place to go.  He gives examples for sentence structures more complicated than a lot of what is presented in the official book.  His lessons we updated in 2015 to better align with Sonja's lessons. Steer clear of PDFs of earlier versions unless you are specifically [looking for historical changes]({% post_url 2020-07-25-historical-experimental-directions %}). His updated examples easier to understand and more tasteful.

[rnd's toki pona page](https://rnd.neocities.org/tokipona/) has a newer set of lessons. The great thing about this one is that it compares multiple approaches using toki pona, which gives a solid foundation for the different ways people prefer to interpret the grammar.  This is also going to make it harder to learn toki pona if you are new, so I might still suggest it as a second or third course. The additional resource are another reason to visit the site.


#### Dictionaries

As each word in toki pona can have more than one definition, all of the meanings that a word might be used for can vary from dictionary to dictionary.  For this reason I like to have several old and new versions on hand:
