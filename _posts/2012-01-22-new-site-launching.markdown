I'm working on getting the site running under WordPress. Right now most of my attention is on converting existing pages into WordPress pages with a little additional dynamic content here and there.  When I get everything launched, my hope is there won't be much to notice-- I want to slip it under the rug so to speak.

The biggest trouble will be re-routing existing links to the new pages, as this site has been running static pages since 2005.  Once I get the projects pages up again, there will be a long list of links to update.

Luckily all the old images are still in great order sitting in a folder in the top directory.  I don't think I'm going to mess around with importing them into the WordPress media folders, because I don't like my images organized by date.  It's the same reason I'll never use iPhoto.

Besides revamping the pages that are already out there, I've been adding a bunch of index pages, to help link from one part of the site to another.  The ability to dump out dynamic index pages has been a great help.

Notice anything you can't find anymore?  Throw me a line!
