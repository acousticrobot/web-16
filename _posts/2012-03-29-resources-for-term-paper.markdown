You will need to choose and Artist for your research paper. The paper should be 2000 words â€“ (approximately 5 pages in length at 1.5 spacing at 12pt type). Pick an artist whose career starts somewhere between 1970 and 2000--that is an established but contemporary artist. Make sure there are enough sources out there for you to research this artist.<!-- more -->





If there is a Wikipedia page for the artist, it is a good indication that there is enough source material out there for you. Look to the external links section of the Wikipedia entry for a list of biographical resources to use.
