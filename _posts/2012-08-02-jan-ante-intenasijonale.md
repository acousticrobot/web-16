excerpt: This is jan Ante's sitelen sitelen using his own translation of L'Internationale. He has his own take on how <em>li</em> could be used as a red band right down the middle of the image, separating the subject from the rest of the sentence.

### artwork by jan Ante, from his translation of **L'Internationale**

![Intenasijonale pi jan Ante](/images/t47/t47.janAnte.intenasijonale_l.jpg)

This is jan Ante's sitelen sitelen using his [own translation](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1172&p=11224&hilit=intenasijonale#p11224) of [L'Internationale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale).  I always found this to be an interesting take on how to organize sitelen glyphs.

jan Ante isn't much of a fan of my using a simple container for _li_, I think he finds it too plain, and so he looked for alternative ways of splitting the subject from the object.  In this piece he used the vertical red band as the _li_, and has placed the subject of each sentence on the left and the verbs and direct objects on the right.

One interesting thing this sets up is the implicit _li_ in all sentences.  All of the sentences with _mi_ as a subject locate the _mi_ on the left of the red bar, and the rest of the sentence on the right.  Also notice how the imperative _o_ is place on the left.  Methods like these for creating meaning through relational positions are what made me interested in developing sitelen sitelen in the first place.

Originally he made it as a [downloadable powerpoint](http://dro.newmail.ru/intenasijonale.ppt) with separate pages, but I've stitched them together here into one long vertical scroll.

jan Ante also put this together based on a slightly earlier version of his translation, here is a copy of the version above with the newer lines added to the right in parenthesis:

>o kama jan pali o kama  
o kama tawa utala _(o utala lon nasin sin!)_  
mi pilin sama nena seli  
tan ni: jan mani li lon ma _(tan ni: jan mani li lon kin.)_  
mi o utala e nasin mani,  
o sin e jan, o sin e ma  
jan pali kin li kama suli  
ona li jo e pan e ma

>ni li utala pini  
tan ni la jan li lon

>o awen ala pona sewi _(o awen ala tawa pona)_  
o awen ala pona jan _(tan sewi anu lawa jan)_

>ni li utala pini

>jan pali taso li ken pana

>ni li utala pini  
tan ni la jan li lon  
ma Intenasijonale  
jan pona sin li lon


### L'Internationale

For a little background, The Internationale was originally written in French in 1871 by the French poet and socialist Eug√®ne Pottier. It has been translated into dozens of languages and used as a rallying song an official anthem of many socialist movements and parties. Check [this site out for audio recordings of The Internationale](http://www.hymn.ru/internationale/index-en.html). Last I counted he had versions of the song in 50 languages!  Anyone want to make a toki pona recording, and bring it up to 51?
