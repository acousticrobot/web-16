excerpt: This conceptual piece was born in the toki pona discussion forums where Matthew Martin (jan Mato) proposed writing up a sales contract in toki pona.  He reasoned that if contracts in foreign languages could be held valid, than one in an artificial language should be valid as well.  As a challenge, he asked if anyone wanted to sell him something using a toki pona contract.

### lipu lawa pi esun kama: a contract for future sales

_(See this original post in the archives [here](/archive/2012/artworks_lipu-lawa-pi-esun-kama.html). This includes a very thorough translation into English by Seth Schoen.)_

This conceptual piece was born in the toki pona discussion forums where Matthew Martin (jan Mato) proposed writing up a sales contract in toki pona.  He reasoned that if contracts in foreign languages could be held valid, than one in an artificial language should be valid as well.  As a challenge, he asked if anyone wanted to sell him something using a toki pona contract.

I responded by proposing that we write a contract in toki pona for the sale of a sitelen sitelen drawing.   The entire negotiation took place in toki pona, aside from grammatical corrections proposed by others during the project, and a brief exchange in English when I wanted to assure him that I was looking to do this for the experiment, not the money.

The contract loosely translated proposed this: we as two agents will create a contract for an exchange of goods.  The contract language will then be translated into the hieroglyphics, and I will draw two copies of the contract, sign both, and send them to Matthew. He in turn signs both, keeps one and returns the other with payment.  In the end we both have a copy of the artwork which doubles as a contract for the sale of itself.

[Here](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1201&start=30#p6046) is the forum post where Matthew proposes creating a contract.  

[Here](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1222&start=0) is the forum where the contract was publicly negotiated.  

[Here](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1265&p=6372) is a forum where Matthew describes his experiences in the exchange.

One of the most absurd things for me in the exchange was the absence of numbers in toki pona. the unofficial convention for 100 is to use _ale_ but this also means _all_.  So where the contract says _"mani Mewika pi nanpa ale"_. Does this looks like _all the numbers of American money_ or _$100_? Toki pona would probably the better in a barter economy, but at some point, aren't you still going to have to say "100 sheep for your house"? Maybe numbers should be a non verbal exchange -- you throw down the number your are talking about in beans. Need to express a very big number?  Better get a bunch of beans!

I was going to translate word for word the contract here, but now I realize it's never been done.  We were both satisfied with the results of the exchange, so I think the goal of the language worked.  But I'm curious just how much of what I thought the contract said actually comes across. If you want to take a stab at translating some or all of it, go ahead and post it in the comments section.  Here is the contract as written:
