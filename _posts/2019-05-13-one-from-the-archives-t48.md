## [t48 - Iliad Cenotaphs](/artworks/t48/)

When we moved out of our Bushwick these pieces all were carefully packed up and have followed me to Queens, Detroit, and finally Ann Arbor.  I haven't seen them in years, and recently was thinking about pulling a couple out of storage.  It also made me want to have them available on line. They never made it onto my short-lived Wordpress site (few pieces did) and so the only images I had on line were in my first site from 2007.

Here again are [all the pieces](/artworks/t48/), as they were originally displayed at the [International Museum of Surgical Sience](https://imss.org/contemporaryart/) back in 2007.
