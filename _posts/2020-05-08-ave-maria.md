I have been slow to post examples of sitelen sitelen here that have been sent to me, and I'm hoping to change that, because I've seen a lot of great examples lately.  Here's one I really enjoyed.  It's the Ave Maria by Tobias Merkle. I especially like the extra circles in the sewi, opening and closing like [Takashi Murakami eyes](https://www.artsy.net/collection/takashi-murakami-jellyfish-eyes).
