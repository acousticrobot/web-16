Recently while I was adding [lesson 10](/toki-pona/lesson-10/) to the sitelen sitelen lessons, jan Inkepa noted that this image used _poka_ without _lon_, counter to the examples in both jan Pije's and jan Sonja's texts:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47/t47.200001.jpg" caption="tomo moku li poka seme?" %}

Indeed, in jan Pije's lessons and in pu, the use of what Sonja calls 'directional nouns' are all the same: _poka, anpa, sewi, insa, monsi_, (and also _noka_ in pu) come after prepositions _lon, tawa, and tan_. I added in a _lon_, but something still didn't feel right to me:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47/t47.200002.jpg" caption="tomo moku li lon poka seme?" %}

Why had I decided to use _poka_ as a container, unlike the other directional nouns?  Going back to look at [lesson 7](/toki-pona/lesson-7/), I found the examples I gave even more troubling:

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47/t47.120001.jpg" caption="mi poka sina." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47/t47.120002.jpg" caption="mi moku lon poka sina." %}

{% include image_and_caption.html image="/images/t47/t47.120003.jpg" caption="ma suli li poka ma lili." %}

Had I always been using _poka_ both inconsistently _and_ wrong?  I looked through the now mostly defunct toki pona forums for discussions I vaguely remembered about this, I found some hints, but a lot of the information is just no longer there.  Then last night it occurred to me, I had the URL for jan Pije's old website in the archives of my lessons.  [Looking at it in the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20141009053259/http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/lesson/lesson7.html) I finally found my answer.  Here is an excerpt from jan Pije's lessons from before they were updated in 2015:

> #### poka

> poka is rather unique in that it can act both as a noun/adjective and also as a preposition. Let's look at each of these uses separately.

> ##### poka as a noun/adjective

> This use is the same as you saw earlier in anpa, insa, monsi, and sewi. Here are some examples:
   - ona li lon poka mi. -- He is at my side. He is beside me.
   - jan poka -- neighbor; someone who is beside you
   - poka telo -- "water side"; in other words, the beach

> ##### poka as a preposition

> Unlike anpa and the rest, poka can also be used directly as a preposition. These two sentences below have the same meaning, but you go about them in a different way:
   - mi moku poka jan pona mi. -- I ate beside my friend.
   - mi moku lon poka pi jan pona mi. -- I ate at side of my friend.
   - (Note: This sentence uses pi, which isn't taught until a later lesson. I wanted to present this usage of poka here, but don't worry if the sentence confuses you due to its use of pi.)

> So, you see, you can treat poka either as a noun/adjective or as a preposition. It's up to you, but whichever way you choose you can still express your thought. Here is another example:
   - mi utala e jan ike poka jan nasa. -- I fought an enemy with a drunk guy.
   - mi utala e jan ike lon poka pi jan nasa. -- I fought an enemy at the side of a drunk guy.

> That's not so bad, now is it?

I remember now how these examples caused me endless confusion when first learning toki pona.  I'm really happy that it's use is now much simpler and consistent with other patterns.

### poka li sitelen poki anu seme?

I do, however, have the pesky problem of examples using _poka_ as a container. I've never really been that happy with the way it fills this role. The top part of _poka_ naturally wants to take up half the glyph, leaving little room for anything else inside. For now as I clean up the examples in lesson 7 to align better with current toki pona, I have also removed any infixes within _poka_ and present it the same as the other directional nouns.

There is however, an amusing alternative.  I could go the other direction and make all of these related glyphs containers as well. For visual clarity, I think they would also have to combine with the leading preposition, similar to how _seme_ operates in the examples in lesson 10. Here are some examples I tried out recently:

{: .wrapper__center-image}
![location containers](/images/t47/t47.200722.jpg)

_tawa monsi_ and _tawa anpa_ with an infix really make me smile when I see them like this. The other's, not so much.  Go ahead some time and give this a try, and let me know if you like something about it. For now though, I'm just happy to simplify both the grammar and the drawings at the same time.
