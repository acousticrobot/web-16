Try out this [Live Toki Pona Sitelen Sitelen Renderer](http://livingtokipona.smoishele.com/examples/liveinput/liveinput.html) by Olaf Janssen, or view the source code with additional examples and installation notes in the [Github repo](https://github.com/olafjanssen/sitelen-sitelen-renderer).

Even though I advocate for learning to draw sitelen sitelen with your hands, I always wanted to see something like this that could convert text into the glyph blocks.  And if you learn best by interacting, this could really aid in teaching you glyph block structures.  It is fairly feature complete, and it's open source so you could always offer some improvements if you felt they were needed.

It handles glyph block sizing surprisingly well, but one of the better features I overlooked at first is that you can use the slider to control the proportions of your final output.  It will alternate from a full vertical stack to a horizontal one. I could see this really coming in handy if you want to quickly iterate over the options for a longer sentence.
