## Why I changed the site

I'm rebuilding this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), in the hope that I'll be actively updating it more regularly. For years now, I've had my site running as a WordPress site.  I learned a lot building in back in 2012, but there were aspect of the site that kept me from using it on a regular basis.

I realize that for the amount that I use my site, having it dependent on a database seems like overkill. Back when I build the Wordpress version, I spend a great deal of time customizing the behavior, and really enjoyed how far I could push my beyond the default blog cms it started as.
