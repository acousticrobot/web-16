<article>
  <p>Recently while I was adding <a href="/toki-pona/lesson-10/">lesson 10</a> to the sitelen sitelen lessons, jan Inkepa noted that this image used <em>poka</em> without <em>lon</em>, counter to the examples in both jan Pije’s and jan Sonja’s texts:</p>

<div class="image-with-caption__centering-wrapper">
  <div class="image-with-caption">
    <div class="image-with-caption__image-block">
      
      <img src="/images/t47/t47.200001.jpg" alt="tomo moku li poka seme?" />
      
    </div>

    
      <div class="image-with-caption__caption-block">
        tomo moku li poka seme?
      </div>
    
  </div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, in jan Pije’s lessons and in pu, the use of what Sonja calls ‘directional nouns’ are all the same: <em>poka, anpa, sewi, insa, monsi</em>, (and also <em>noka</em> in pu) come after prepositions <em>lon, tawa, and tan</em>. I added in a <em>lon</em>, but something still didn’t feel right to me:</p>

<div class="image-with-caption__centering-wrapper">
  <div class="image-with-caption">
    <div class="image-with-caption__image-block">
      
      <img src="/images/t47/t47.200002.jpg" alt="tomo moku li lon poka seme?" />
      
    </div>

    
      <div class="image-with-caption__caption-block">
        tomo moku li lon poka seme?
      </div>
    
  </div>
</div>

<p>Why had I decided to use <em>poka</em> as a container, unlike the other directional nouns?  Going back to look at <a href="/toki-pona/lesson-7/">lesson 7</a>, I found the examples I gave even more troubling:</p>

<div class="image-with-caption__centering-wrapper">
  <div class="image-with-caption">
    <div class="image-with-caption__image-block">
      
      <img src="/images/t47/t47.120001.jpg" alt="mi poka sina." />
      
    </div>

    
      <div class="image-with-caption__caption-block">
        mi poka sina.
      </div>
    
  </div>
</div>

<div class="image-with-caption__centering-wrapper">
  <div class="image-with-caption">
    <div class="image-with-caption__image-block">
      
      <img src="/images/t47/t47.120002.jpg" alt="mi moku lon poka sina." />
      
    </div>

    
      <div class="image-with-caption__caption-block">
        mi moku lon poka sina.
      </div>
    
  </div>
</div>

<div class="image-with-caption__centering-wrapper">
  <div class="image-with-caption">
    <div class="image-with-caption__image-block">
      
      <img src="/images/t47/t47.120003.jpg" alt="ma suli li poka ma lili." />
      
    </div>

    
      <div class="image-with-caption__caption-block">
        ma suli li poka ma lili.
      </div>
    
  </div>
</div>

<p>Had I always been using <em>poka</em> both inconsistently <em>and</em> wrong?  I looked through the now mostly defunct toki pona forums for discussions I vaguely remembered about this, I found some hints, but a lot of the information is just no longer there.  Then last night it occurred to me, I had the URL for jan Pije’s old website in the archives of my lessons.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141009053259/http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/lesson/lesson7.html">Looking at it in the Wayback Machine</a> I finally found my answer.  Here is an excerpt from jan Pije’s lessons from before they were updated in 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="poka">poka</h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>poka is rather unique in that it can act both as a noun/adjective and also as a preposition. Let’s look at each of these uses separately.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h5 id="poka-as-a-nounadjective">poka as a noun/adjective</h5>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This use is the same as you saw earlier in anpa, insa, monsi, and sewi. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ona li lon poka mi. – He is at my side. He is beside me.</li>
    <li>jan poka – neighbor; someone who is beside you</li>
    <li>poka telo – “water side”; in other words, the beach</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h5 id="poka-as-a-preposition">poka as a preposition</h5>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike anpa and the rest, poka can also be used directly as a preposition. These two sentences below have the same meaning, but you go about them in a different way:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mi moku poka jan pona mi. – I ate beside my friend.</li>
    <li>mi moku lon poka pi jan pona mi. – I ate at side of my friend.</li>
    <li>(Note: This sentence uses pi, which isn’t taught until a later lesson. I wanted to present this usage of poka here, but don’t worry if the sentence confuses you due to its use of pi.)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, you see, you can treat poka either as a noun/adjective or as a preposition. It’s up to you, but whichever way you choose you can still express your thought. Here is another example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mi utala e jan ike poka jan nasa. – I fought an enemy with a drunk guy.</li>
    <li>mi utala e jan ike lon poka pi jan nasa. – I fought an enemy at the side of a drunk guy.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s not so bad, now is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember now how these examples caused me endless confusion when first learning toki pona.  I’m really happy that it’s use is now much simpler and consistent with other patterns.</p>

<h3 id="poka-li-sitelen-poki-anu-seme">poka li sitelen poki anu seme?</h3>

<p>I do, however, have the pesky problem of examples using <em>poka</em> as a container. I’ve never really been that happy with the way it fills this role. The top part of <em>poka</em> naturally wants to take up half the glyph, leaving little room for anything else inside. For now as I clean up the examples in lesson 7 to align better with current toki pona, I have also removed any infixes within <em>poka</em> and present it the same as the other directional nouns.</p>

<p>There is however, an amusing alternative.  I could go the other direction and make all of these related glyphs containers as well. For visual clarity, I think they would also have to combine with the leading preposition, similar to how <em>seme</em> operates in the examples in lesson 10. Here are some examples I tried out recently:</p>

<p class="wrapper__center-image"><img src="/images/t47/t47.200722.jpg" alt="location containers" /></p>

<p><em>tawa monsi</em> and <em>tawa anpa</em> with an infix really make me smile when I see them like this. The other’s, not so much.  Go ahead some time and give this a try, and let me know if you like something about it. For now though, I’m just happy to simplify both the grammar and the drawings at the same time.</p>
