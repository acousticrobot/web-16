Savory Chickpeas in Tangy Tomato Glaze modified from Yamuna Devi's "The Lord Krishna's Cuisine"The original recipe is Vedic so it doesn't call for the onion or garlic.  I often omit the curry leaves if I don't have them but they are a treat; you can find them in the refrigerator of any Indian grocer.  I don't measure the spices when I add them and probably add more than the recipe calls for. I also use a lot less than the 5 tbsp oil it calls for, probably only 1-2 tbsp.heat 5 tbsp ghee or oil in a large sauce pan. Add:	1 1/2 tsp fresh ginger, grated	2-3 jalepe–os or other green chilies, seeded and minced	1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds	1/2  tsp black mustard seeds	2 cloves garlic, mashed	half onion, mincedwhen the cumin turns brown, add in:	8-12 fresh curry leavesstir for a couple seconds, then add:	5 medium tomatoes, peeled and diced	1 tsp turmeric	1 tsp chat masala, or juice from half lemon	1 tsp garam masala	1/4 cup chopped cilantro (add half this now, and the rest right before serving)stir and cook medium heat 3-5 minutes until oil separates from sauce and texture is smooth and even.  Add in:1 1/4 c. dried chickpeas, cooked, or 2 cans chickpeas washed and drained1 1/4 tsp saltreduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
