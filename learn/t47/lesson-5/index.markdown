### Compound nouns





If you feel you are starting to understand how to stack your glyph blocks, adding modifiers shouldn't be too hard. Let's look at jan Pije's example, building up to _this good soldier_.






    

![jan](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_01.jpg)

jan









    

![jan utala](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_02.jpg)

jan utala









    

![jan utala pona ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_04.jpg)

jan utala pona ni









    

![jan utala pona](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_03.jpg)

jan utala pona








This compound noun block is equally at home as the subject, or direct object.






    

![jan utala pona ni li lawa.](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_05.jpg)

jan utala pona ni li lawa.









    

![mi lawa e jan utala pona ni.](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_06.jpg)

mi lawa e jan utala pona ni.








In chapter 2 we talked about tucking glyphs behind others. Look how well this works for the combination _jan utala_ in these examples.





### Short blocks: lili and mute






    

![jan lili](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_07.jpg)

jan lili









    

![tomo mute](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_08.jpg)

tomo mute









    

![jan nasa mute](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_09.jpg)

jan nasa mute








Lili and mute are wider and shorter than some of the more square glyphs.





As modifiers this can work to your advantage, as they don't take up too much space. Often they can tuck right underneath the noun they are modifying.





### Thin blocks: ni






    

![telo nasa ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_12.jpg)

telo nasa ni









    

![ilo seli ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_11.jpg)

ilo seli ni








Remember in lesson 1 we said syllable glyphs can be used instead of glyph blocks? As a glyph block, ni is pretty square, but as a syllable it is tall and thin.






    

![len ni ](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_10.jpg)

len ni 








This can be useful when ni is used as a modifier. Take a look at how ni works here as a syllable block and above as a glyph block.  This can offer you a variety of ways to fill the given space in any situation.





### Stretching and squishing blocks






    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_13.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni









    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_14.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni








Maybe you have started to notice, glyph blocks have a little bit of give to them. 






    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_15.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni








They can stretch or squish in order to maintain a square shape in a multi-block structure. 






    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_16.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni









    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_17.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni








If you understand how to tuck one glyph behind another, to stretch or squish glyphs, and use short and thin blocks, you will see just how many different arrangements there are for compound blocks. 






    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_18.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni









    

![ma ike jaki ni](/images/t47_tokipona/t47_kamasona/t47_kaso05_19.jpg)

ma ike jaki ni








Here are seven different ways to arrange ma ike jaki ni. Which one you would want to choose would depend on the how well it fits in the rest of the sentence.
